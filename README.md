A simple network graph that illustrates the SEC's "revolving door". Brushing up on creating network graphs and I thought others would find this useful.

[Data](http://www.pogo.org/tools-and-data/sec-revolving-door-database/data/?former_division_office=&former_title=&new_employer=&dateType=date_of_resignation&startDate=&endDate=) from the Project for Government Oversight.

Includes the parser for the raw HTML data, parser output (graph.json) and the visualization (in www/), made simple with Mike Bostock's D3 library.
